# Hahn_Cavarlho_Posterior_Summarization

[Hahn and Cavarlho (2015)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2014.993077) proposed a sparse posterior summarization technique for Bayesian linear regression models. This project investigates the accuracy of their method by comparing the results to other propular feature
selection techniques, like LASSO and Elastic Net. In addition, we will restrict our analysis to highly multicollinear datasets, as they usually pose a greater challenge to a data analyst.

Our analysis shows that Hahn and Cavarlho's posterior summarization method, especially when utilized with spike and slab priors, provides comparable results to other popular frequentist methods. Therefore, the method proves to be a worthwhile step in Bayesian linear regression analysis.
